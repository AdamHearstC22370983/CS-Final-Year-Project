"Skillgap" is a web-based software application that provides personalised suggestions for upskilling courses based on what the user is qualified in already and what they must achieve to be considered for existing/upcoming job vacancies. 
The user creates a profile by inputting their email, password and some personal details and a copy of their current CV. Skillgap parses the user's CV and provided Job Description and provides:


- A personalised Skill-gap analysis between the user's current qualifications/skills and the position requirements for candidates in the provided Job Description.
- Recommended upskilling paths online (free courses, paid courses, certifications).

Optional features include:
- Favourites tab for courses the user wishes to take.
- Entry-level job listings that align woth their current set of skills (optional).

The system uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand CVs and user input, and machine learning (ML) and APIs to recommend upskilling paths that align with the user's goals.
