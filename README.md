"Pathfinder" is a web-based software application that provides intelligent, personalized career guidance for users based on their existing skills, education, and aspirations. Users upload their CV or fill out a questionnaire. The AI parses the CV and provides:

Tailored job role suggestions
Skill-gap analysis
Suggested upskilling paths (courses, certifications)
Entry-level job listings (optional)

The system uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand CVs and user input, and machine learning (ML) or LLM (e.g., OpenAI) to recommend career paths aligned with the current job market.
